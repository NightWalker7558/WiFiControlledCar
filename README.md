# WiFi-Controlled Car

<!-- uses ESP32, L293D, Blynk IoT, Simulation present on Wokwi: https://wokwi.com/projects/417406009966472193 -->

This project is a WiFi-controlled car that can be controlled using a smartphone. The car is powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and uses the L293D motor driver to control the motors. The car can be controlled using the Blynk IoT app, which allows you to control the car remotely over WiFi.

## Components Required

- ESP32 Dev Board
- L293D Motor Driver
- DC Motors (2)
- Chassis
- Wheels (2)
- Battery
- Jumper Wires
